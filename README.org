* Simple ansible playbooks to create and update a free instance
  - GCP provides a (so far) permanent free tier of usage.

* Getting started
 - Ensure you have your gcp credentials and ssh-key. See [[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_gce.html][ansible docs]] for more info.
 - Set the ~GCP_PROJECT~ & ~GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE~ env variables and replace ~inventory/gce-inventory.gcp.yml~ with the information.
 - The env variables ~USER~ & ~SSH_PUB_KEY~ will be used for ssh login name and ssh pubkey file location.
 - Run desired playbook using the GCE inventory.

* Create instance
 - ~ansible-playbook -i inventory/gce-inventory.gcp.yml provision.yml~
   - Creates a ~f1-micro~ instance with ~30GiB~ disk in the ~us-east1-b~ zone with the name of ~free-1~.
     Adds the ~http-server~, ~https-server~ and ~ssh-server~ tags for default firewall rules of Port ~80~, ~443~ and ~22~ respectively.
     Adds the ~webserver~ tag for tracking.

* Update instance
 - ~ansible-playbook -i inventory/gce-inventory.gcp.yml rolling_update.yml~
 - applies the common and web roles

* Destroy instance
 - ~ansible-playbook -i inventory/gce-inventory.gcp.yml destroy.yml~

* Customization
 - The vars in ~group_vars/gce~ can be customized

* TODO: maybe some or maybe none
 - gcp setup (inventory, project, keys, roles, firewall rules, etc... )
 - include other free services allocations (storage bucket in ~US-CENTRAL1~ etc)
 - multiple OS support in roles
 - move to role based provisioning
